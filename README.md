# Autonomous GPT Ts

### 🏔 Purpose
The purpose of this codebase is to build my foundational knowledge in out auto-gpt works, I wanted to build this project from scratch to truly comprehend the underlying ideas. Most of the concepts and ideas are the same (and a lot of the structure is heavily inspired by Auto-GPT); the main difference in the implementation between this implementation (at the time I start this project) and the original Auto-GPT codebase is that I took a more OOO approach to keep it maintainability and a bit of DDD inspiration for modularity.
