The apiKey and searchEngineId are required for using Google's Custom Search JSON API to perform searches programmatically.

apiKey: This is a unique key that identifies your application and allows you to access the Google Custom Search JSON API. To create an API key, follow these steps:

a. Go to the Google Cloud Console.

b. If you haven't already, create a new project or select an existing one.

c. Click on the hamburger menu (three horizontal lines) in the top left corner, and navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials."

d. Click on "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" at the top and select "API key." A new API key will be generated. Make sure to copy and store it securely.

searchEngineId: This identifier is specific to a Custom Search Engine (CSE) that you create for your project. To create a Custom Search Engine and obtain the search engine ID, follow these steps:

a. Go to the Google Programmable Search Engine page.

b. Click "Get started" and sign in with your Google account.

c. Click on "Create a custom search engine" or "New search engine."

d. Provide a list of websites you want to search, or leave it empty to search the entire web.

e. Follow the instructions to set up your search engine. After you've created it, go to the "Setup" tab and click on the "Search engine ID" button. Copy the search engine ID.

Once you have the API key and search engine ID, you can use them in your Google Search class to perform searches using the Google Custom Search JSON API.
